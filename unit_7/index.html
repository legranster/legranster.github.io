			<img  class="headshot" src="images/headshot.jpg" alt="Veronica Headshot">
			<p> Veronica discovered Pilates nearly 15 years ago and has been hooked ever since. Following the addition of Pilates into her routine, she truly realized the amazing benefits that Pilates had in store for her. In order to deepen her practice and understanding, Veronica began instructor training. </p>
			<p>Without ever expecting it, she fell in love with teaching, and in 2015, Veronica completed the 500-hour comprehensive Pilates instructor training through Balanced Body©. Over the past seven years, Veronica has made it her mission to share her love of Pilates through teaching at a variety of studios from New Jersey to Boston and New York City. </p>
